    <br>Freelance Data Analyst • Digital Project Manager • RDBMS Design and Automation Expert
    
    <p>
        With 20 years of multidisciplinary experience, I specialize in driving complex projects from concept to execution—on time, within scope, and aligned with strategic goals. My unique strength lies in combining technical fluency with strong leadership, enabling me to effectively manage and/or engage with fast-paced onshore and offshore teams, and deliver solutions that balance innovation, usability, and business impact.
    </p>
    <p>
        As a Digital Project Manager, I bring a strong foundation in Agile and Scrum methodologies, stakeholder engagement, and cross-functional team coordination. I excel at leading change, adaptive planning, emotional intelligence, fostering an open, positive, and collaborative culture, and aligning technical teams with creative and business objectives.
    </p>
    <p>
        My background in data analysis, RDBMS design, and automation development equips me to add value not only as a process leader but also as a problem-solver—diving into data, streamlining workflows, enhancing operational efficiency, and delivering data-driven insights through intelligent dashboards and reporting systems.
    </p>
    <p>
        Over the years of my professional career, I’ve successfully led digital and data projects for some of the world’s leading international brands—including DELL, HSBC, GSK, Pfizer, and others—managing cross-border teams, agencies, and partners, and ensuring high-quality delivery across web, content, SEO, and digital advertising initiatives. Additionally, I’ve developed custom software applications and automation tools for USAID Dhaka and UNICEF Dhaka to streamline internal processes, monitor donor funds, and evaluate project performance.
    </p>
    <p>
        I'm open to impactful roles and collaborations with organizations that value strategic thinking, continuous improvement, and measurable outcomes—so I can lead with purpose, empower teams to thrive, and help turn complex challenges into measurable success.
